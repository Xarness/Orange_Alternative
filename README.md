# Orange_Alternative

### This is a projct to leverage the power of Orange community in creating a good work closely connected to Orange of LeviTamm. <br>
To achieve such goals we need volunteer writers, and judging readers to combine scattered ideas and stories, selectively choosing only the best parts to create one bigger work.<br>
To achieve quality, writers can't be too atached to what they have written may be changed or midfied by other writers, in fact it is encouraged to propose such changes.<br>

### There will be list of current tasks and projects that are going around so anyone who wants to contribute can find somewhere to join, or alternatively propose new thing.<br>
For those not knowing how github works and they still want to contribute, you can post it somewhere on the discord channel or to project leaders. <br>
However it is encouraged to ask ChatGPT or watch 15 minutes tutorial explaining how to at least copy paste inside github to a file and make pull request, or if someone is ambitious: know how to download git, fork the repo, pull the repo on their pc, optionally create new branch, add the file they want, commit and push that branch and create pull request. <br>

### It is fairly easy with AI help or 10 mins yt videos: <br>
beginner, just in browser: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuWAw-RBPys
intermediate, download to pc and push: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSjyU2vf6Y
advanced, create branches after forking and before pull request: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLRA1lffWBw

You can just post word document to current files or update present ones or add comments to changes etc.
